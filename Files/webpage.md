# Pickling, Exceptions, and the Worth Encryption Ever
## Introduction

The main topics for this assignment are pickling, a method to save objects in Python in a binary format, and exceptions, ways to handle the appearance of an error during run time other than crashing the program. It does so with a fanciful application to encrypt text messages by pickling them and saving in a presumably unreadable to human eyes binary format. Since the encryption is not serious but rather a fun way to explore the programming topics, we can state upfront that pickled text is not always very hard to read at all, as the examples will show.
